FOSSology is a powerful tool, but its interface doesn’t fully reflect its strengths. Navigation is unintuitive, tasks take longer than needed, and the visual system lacks consistency. My proposal focused on redesigning the interface with usability and accessibility at its core, while also ensuring that components are lightweight and not code-heavy, making them easier for developers to implement and maintain.

To address these challenges, the project began with evaluating the current interface through cognitive testing, heuristic analysis, and accessibility checks. User needs and pain points were then mapped to define redesign requirements, which guided the creation of workflows and high-fidelity mockups reviewed with stakeholders. Alongside this, a design system was established with standardized styles and reusable, lightweight components to ensure consistency, scalability, and ease of contribution.

The goal of this project was not just to modernize the look, but to make FOSSology genuinely easier to use, smoother navigation, reduced cognitive load, and better accessibility across user groups. A cleaner interface and streamlined workflows will help users adopt the tool more easily, while the design system ensures consistency, making it simpler for contributors to maintain and extend for the community’s future growth.

<h2>1. Evaluating the Current Interface </h2>

To begin the redesign, the first step was evaluating FOSSology’s current interface to identify key usability issues. This evaluation combined Cognitive Testing using the VIMM Model to assess user effort in completing tasks, Usability Analysis based on Jakob Nielsen’s Heuristic Principles to detect design and interaction flaws, and Accessibility Analysis following WCAG guidelines to ensure inclusivity in areas such as color contrast, navigation, and form usage. 


<h3>Cognitive Testing - VIMM Model </h3>

Cognitive testing was carried out using the VIMM Model to understand the mental effort required for users to perform common tasks in FOSSology. This approach looked at Visual, Intellectual, Memory, and Motor aspects of interaction, allowing us to see where users were struggling with unnecessary complexity or confusion. 

This helped prioritize redesign areas that directly reduced user friction and cognitive load. 


<h3>Usability Analysis - Jakob Nielsen’s Heuristic Principles</h3>

The interface was also evaluated against Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics to uncover design flaws and inconsistencies. Each heuristic such as visibility of system status, error prevention, consistency, and user control was systematically reviewed against existing workflows.

Heuristic evaluation provided a comprehensive picture of where the interface broke common usability standards, giving a clear foundation for improvement.


<h3>Accessibility Analysis - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</h3>

An accessibility review was conducted using WCAG standards to ensure the interface supported a diverse range of users. This included checking color contrast for readability and accessibility. The analysis showed that while FOSSology was functional, it had accessibility gaps that limited inclusivity. 

Addressing these gaps ensured the redesign would support broader adoption and better accessibility

<h2>2. User Research and Redesign Requirements </h2>

The project focused on identifying key users, their primary tasks, and the pain points they faced with the existing interface. These insights were then categorized by impact (high, medium, low) and converted into structured redesign requirements and design recommendations, ensuring that the most critical issues were resolved first while leaving room for iterative improvements.


<br>
<h2>3. Creating Workflows and High-Fidelity Screens </h2>

The design process began with translating the defined requirements into low-fidelity wireframes or by recreating the current UI with updated components to explore possible solutions. These were then refined into high-fidelity screens for feedback and review, followed by clickable prototypes that showcased improved workflows and interface elements in practice. 

<br>
<h2>4. Established a Design System </h2>

The design system was developed by standardizing typography, colors, spacing, and iconography to establish a cohesive visual identity across the platform. Reusable UI components were created to maintain consistency and reduce development effort, while also ensuring that the interface remained lightweight and easy to implement. This approach not only improved the overall user experience but also provided scalability, making future enhancements more efficient and enabling contributors to extend the system with clarity and consistency.

<h3>Icons</h3>
Custom icons were designed from scratch to align with the style of the new components, adding to the overall coherence of the system. These icons were licensed under CC BY 4.0, meaning they can be freely used in personal or commercial projects with visible credit: “Icons by Devanshi.”
